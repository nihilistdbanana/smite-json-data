# Smite JSON Data

## About the Project

This is for my personal data collection, to run data analysis on smite Gods, Items, and hopefully Maps, in a temporal manner.<br><br>

## Ramble On (My attempt at casually explaining this project)
This is a public repository and will be open for anyone to use and analyze.<br>
This will be json data so that everyone can get access to clean data and does not have to rely on complex APIs or web scraping.<br><br>
I also think this will make it easier for smite lovers to base projects or posts involving use of such data and hopefully spread the popularity of the game even more!!.<br><br>
I want to invite anyone who wants to contribute with some json files. Please read the README and CONTRIBUTION files beforehand.<br>
It would be even better if you want to help me out figure out how to structure the data. Because I only have the basic details structure figured out right now.<br>
